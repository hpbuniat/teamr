# teamr
You're having a cup for EA's popular football simulation, but no clue how to fairly assign teams to all players?
Sick of keeping notes up to date, to ensure a proper & fair team-roster?

Here comes **teamr**!

**teamr** takes the number of players, groups (e.g. when playing with many people) and the desired team-rating (absolute values and/or stars), giving you nice & fair groups for your tournament.
